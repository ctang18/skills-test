## Request

We would like to have a form where a potential customer can contact a sales representative. 
Upon form submission, the page should redirect to the same thank you page URL, but have different messaging depending 
on the number of employees that they have. If they have 1-49 employees, the message should say "Mike will be in contact with you shortly!"
If they have 50+ employees, the thank you message should say "Sam will be in contact with you shortly!"

In practice, the form will be provided by a third party, so it should be considered immutable, other than for styling reasons. 
This means that you can not use the typical form "post" method of passing infomation between pages.

You can submit multiple solutions if you can think of them, but don't use any external libraries except for jQuery.

The styling is very rough and should be brought up to an reasonable level, but don't spend too much time on it.

## Nice To Haves

We don't want to let users think they are getting different levels of treatment, so an average user should not 
be able to tell that we send them different messaging based on their number of employees.
